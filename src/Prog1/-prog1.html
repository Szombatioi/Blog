        <h2>BME 1st semester - Minesweeper in C</h2>
        <p>For the first semester of university we had a subject called Programming 1, in which we learned C and the implementation of many data structures and programming methods.</p>
        <p>The subject required a homework to be made, I choose Minesweeper with a graphical user interface, just because this game wouldn't be cool in a console and I wanted to learn more about game graphics.</p>
        <p>For the graphical implementation I used SDL which is a commonly used wrapper for operating-system-specific functions that a graphical game requires. Since SDL does not have any pre-written UI elements (buttons, timers, etc.) I also had to implement these myself.</p>
        <p>The game was a success, I got maximum points for it and it even got into the subject's Game Beauty Contest for an additional 2 points.</p>
